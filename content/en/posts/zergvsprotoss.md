## Standard Opener

| Milestone      | What to Make     | Tips/How to Execute --     |
| -------------: | :---------- | :----------- |
|  Supply 13 | Overlord   | Send this overlord to your second base to scout for cannon rushes or probe scouts. |
|  Supply 16 | Hatchery   | Pull a drone from your mineral line @ ~200 minerals. |
|  Supply 18 | Gas   | Rally 17th drone from egg |
|  Supply 17 | Spawning Pool   | Rally 18th drone from egg |
|   |    | Saturate Gas through rallying the next 2 building drones and 1 drone from  your minerals) |
|  Supply 20 | Overlord then 2x Queens 4x Lings   | Make and overlord and when the pool finishes make 2 queens and 2 sets of lings |
|  Supply 30 | Third Hatchery | For larva and economy |
|  Gas 100 | Metabolic Boost | Zergling speed, after this finishes make 4 more lings to be safe |
|  Supply 31 | Third Queen | |
|  Supply 31 | Overlord ||
|  @100% first inject | Make 2 drones and rally into your extractor |This times it out perfectly for 3:30 to have the right amount of gas later|
|  Supply 40 | Overlord ||
|  Supply 42 | Fourth Queen | At the second base|
|  @If their second gateway unit isnt a stalker | Send overlord into their main base | Look for their building count and what tech they have|


## Playing againts Stargate openers
Stargate openers are generally the openers that go into a standard game. Meaning they take a third and have a more defensive setup. This is a branch of build order to help you get into the midgame cleanly.

| Milestone      | What to Make     | Tips/How to Execute --     |
| -------------: | :---------- | :----------- |
|  @3:30-3:50 | Spores 3:30 for oracle first, 3:50 for phoenix first   | You can make a spore in the main base, and defend the natural with queens if you'd like or just make 2 spores |
|  @4:30 | Lair + 2 gasses + roach warren   | This is a safe timing to transition to midgame|
|  @5:00 | Evolution Chamber + 1 gas   | @100 evolution chamber start +1 meele, after +1 meele start +2 |
|  @100% Lair | Roach speed + Baneling nest   | Start baneling speed when the nest is done |
|  @60 drones | 8-12 safety roaches   | Depending on what you scout here it could be necessary, there is a deeper breakdown in the video |
|  @5:30-6:00  |  Should have 66 drones here and forth started  | Scout their third to check if they have gassses, if there are no gasses make units before going up to 75 drones - 80 drones |

## Playing againts Twilight and robo openers
There are many different builds that can come out of a twilight or robo opener, this build order helps defend them. However because of the number of builds that are possible from this opener I will go more in depth in the video explaining it.
Twilight openers 

| Milestone      | What to Make     | Tips/How to Execute --     |
| -------------: | :---------- | :----------- |
|  @41 drones | Make 30ish lings   | These lings are to stop the first wave of adepts/chargelots |
|  @4:00 | Roach Warren   | You'll make roaches while stalling with lings vs any attack|
|  @5:00 | Lair + 2 gasses, scout for a third timing   | After defending their attack with lings and roaches your next worry is any followup attack, lair and more gas will help with that |
|  @5:30 | Evo + 1 gas   | Scout for tech and any attack they might execute, get +1 ranged or +1 meele depending on how roach or ling heavy you want to go|
