Intro
This is the complete guide to standard Roach based ZvP. Since Ling bane hydra styles against Protoss are very different, that style will be a separate guide. It will focus on the highest levels of ZvP play as well as strong responses to various common Protoss builds. This means all of the strategies and timings in this guide will be focused on the highest levels of play and as such, you may see various other builds on the ladder or similar builds at later timings. If you are at a lower level of play, focus on the order everything is built and the benchmarks that the build aims to hit rather than the specific times that everything is happening. To follow this build order, choose either the European opening or the Korean opening, follow the reaction to the build order you scout and then follow the transition to one of the army compositions listed.

Build Order
Opening
There are two types of standard opener build orders in ZvP currently. The first  builds two queens and four zerglings on 20 supply in order to start injecting, creep spread and push back the scouting probe to take the third base on 30-32 supply. The second builds the third hatchery on 20 supply by delaying the first two queens and third overlord. In general, the first opening is much more popular from European pros such as Serral and Lambo and the second is much more popular from Korean Pros such as Dark or Rogue. Because of this, I will refer to each as either the EU opening or the KR opening. Jump here to read more about the pros and cons of each opening.

European Opening
13 – Overlord
16 – Hatchery (15 hatch on tiny maps such as blueshift)
18 – Extractor (rally 17th drone from egg)

Rally next 2 drones into gas and pull 1 from the mineral line
Rally last drone back to minerals

Reaction VS Twilight Council First
There are a few different twilight council PvZ openings however they mainly consist of DT archon drop, chargelot based all ins, gladept based all ins, or gladept based timing attacks. Against Twilight Council / Robotics facility builds, after defending going spire and making ~8 mutas is also a powerful transition. Often times Protoss players will do a follow up all in and the mutas are strong at delaying their attack, hindering their economy and shutting down the all in by killing the warp prism. 
To Scout: the first thing to look for is whether or not the Protoss Cybernetics core starts researching as it finishes building. Twilight council first builds will start warp gate immediately while star gate openings will start the star gate before warp gate, meaning it will take a few seconds before the cyber core starts researching.  Additionally, stalker first or right after the first adept is more common when going twilight council (as you will not have a phoenix to kill the overlord).

Cancel Zergling Speed
@~3:05 / first inject pops – Rally 2 drones from eggs into gas
@3:30 – Roach Warren + Lair
44 – 2x Extractors (full 2 base mineral saturation)

Reaction VS DT Archon Drop
The DT Archon drop hits with 4 DTs @5:00 or 2 Archons @5:30 and a warp prism. Additionally, they can add early charge as well as a couple of gateways to add a chargezealot warp in round (6 Chargelots). There is another DT Archon drop that hits with DTs @4:30, however it is less economic. If you cancel ling speed and response with fast lair, you will have detection in time.
To Scout: this is a twilight council first build with no star gate opener. They will not be researching anything from the twilight council, they will only have 1 gateway in the wall (with 3 being added on at ~3:30-3:40 to warp in 4 dts). Scouting the dark shrine ensures that it is some type of DT play, likely a DT archon drop build. Against this build, the Protoss will take their natural gases at 4:00. Because the additional gateways are so late, this build often puts the robotics facility in the wall off. 

@4:10 – Spore Crawler (@Main Base)
@4:30 / 100% Lair –  Overseer (@Third base) + Roach Speed
@50 Drones / 100% Roach Warren – 10-16 Roaches
@Protoss Attack – Defend with 10-16 Roaches, 2 creep queens, 1 inject queen and overseer

Reaction VS 2 Base Chargelot Archon All in
Chargelot Archon All ins can be off of 2 bases or 3 bases but the 3 base will be a fake. They will go up to 4 gases (differential between the pure chargelot all in). 
To Scout: they will have a non researching Templar archives, 4 gases, many gateways (8 is usual) and potentially a third base. If there is no third base by 5:00 be cautious of one of the three all ins. If they do take a third base, it will likely be extra early (~4:30) so that there is time for you to scout it and feel safe, however they will not saturate the base at all and will stop building probes in the main and natural (you can tell if you get a scouting ling in by looking at the nexus). 

@100% Lair – Roach Speed
@52 Drones  – Constant Roach Production
@5:00 – Fourth Extractor
Defend with mass roach and your defense / creep queens. Highly suggested you make 3 ravagers to snipe the warp prism once it goes into warp mode if you have the gas. Once you have successfully defended transition.

Reaction VS 2 Base Chargelot All in
The gasless Chargelot all in stops at 32 probes, stops mining gas once they have charge and the robotics facility started and hits around 5:00. The Protoss will have ~8 gateways and be warping in 8 charge zealots each warp in round. Against this all in, if you will still be ahead if you lose your third, this means that creating an evolution chamber wall to reduce chargelot surface area at your natural base is a solid tactic that can help you survive and come out ahead. This is especially useful if you scout the all in late and drone over 41.

To Scout: No gas mining in the main, Gateway explosion begins around 3:15, once they hit 32 probes they will stop producing probes, will have not taken a third base by 5:00. If neither natural gases is taken by 4:00 then it is likely a chargelot all in. 

@100% Lair – Roach Speed
@41 Drones – Constant Roach Production
@5:00 – Defend with mass Roach and 5 Queens
Once you have defended counter attack with mass roach and win the game.
You can either continue making roaches and do a counter all in, or counter attack with just the roaches you have and transition with drones to roach swarmhost or roach hydra.

Reaction VS 2 Base Gladept All in
To Scout: the Protoss will have an unusual amount of adepts in their wall and will generally take 1 gas at their natural. Otherwise the scouting signs are the same as the 2 base chargelot archon all in. 

To defend, follow the reaction vs the chargelot archon all in. However When defending adepts, you will need to split your roach queen into two separate groups, one to follow the shades and one to attack the adepts. After defending the attack, counter attack and transition similar to the reaction vs 2 base chargelot all in.

Reaction VS Star Gate First
Star gate openings are by far the most common PvZ opening because they keep the Protoss safe, give the Protoss scouting, deny Zerg scouting and allow a lot of variety in the follow up. 

To Scout: Warp gate won’t start right away (closer to ~2:25). Send Overlord into their base once their second unit from warp gate unit has been made (if adept). If a phoenix starts killing your overlord at ~3:25 then it is phoenix first if it doesn’t then it is oracle first.

@3:30 – 2x Spore Crawlers if oracle first (main and third)
@3:50 – 2x Spore Crawlers if phoenix first (main and third)
@4:20 – Lair + 2x Extractors
@4:35 – Roach Warren
@100% Roach Warren – Roach Speed + Roaches (# of roaches depends on your scouting)

Reaction VS Star Gate into Archon Drop
One of the two main standard PvZ builds is the Star Gate into Archon Drop, the other being 2 star gate phoenix. 

To Scout: both standard builds will take 2 gases at the natural around 3:30. To confirm whether it is 2 stargate phoenix or archon drop, you will need to patron single zerglings along as many pathways as possible to see the warp prism or phoenix leaving. 

Build ~12 Roaches against the standard archon drop and ~16 Roaches against archon drop with charge zealot pressure. 

Reaction VS 2 Star gate Phoenix
The other main standard PvZ build, double star gate phoenix. 

To Scout: both standard builds will take 2 gases at the natural around 3:30. To confirm whether it is 2 stargate phoenix or archon drop, you will need to patron single zerglings along as many pathways as possible to see the warp prism or phoenix leaving.

 You only need to build units against an adept timing follow up to the phoenix. In which case build ~3x Zerglings / adept. 
5x Spore Crawlers (1 natural, 2 main, 2 third)
Keep your defense queens in your natural. Send all overlords to a defend-able position in a mineral line.
@5:40 – Hydralisk Den + Go up to 6 gases (should be at least at 5 gases by now but gas times will depend on your desire composition described below) 
@100% Hydralisk Den – Hydralisk Range
@66-72 Drones – 15 Hydralisk + 4th Base
