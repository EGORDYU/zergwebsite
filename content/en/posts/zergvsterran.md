New to Zerg? Here's a detailed guide how to beat Terran!
{{< /alert >}}



## Introduction
Zerg vs Terran (ZvT) is the simplest matchup in the game. 

You can do the same build order every game and get away with it because of the simple interactions between early defensive Zerg units and the Terrans' early aggressive units. 

This guide outlines what is the most dependable and consistent way to play versus Terran.

## Standard Opener

This is whats commonly known as the QLASH opening, since zergs on the team QLASH broke it into the meta, you will get your third base down before the reaper arrives, so it won't get blocked.

{{< at at="13 Overlord" >}} Send this overlord to your natural to scout for their scouting SCV or any potential bunker rushes.{{< / >}}

{{< at at="16 Hatchery" >}} Pull a drone from your mineral line @ ~200 minerals. (A hatchery first is safe vs virtually any build) {{< / >}}

{{< at at="18 Gas" >}} (rally 17th drone from egg){{< / >}}

{{< at at="17 Spawning Pool " >}} (rally 18th drone from egg){{< / >}}

{{< at >}} Saturate Gas through rallying the next 2 drones and 1 from minerals{{< / >}}

{{< at at="20 2x Queens 4x Lings" >}} {{< / >}}

{{< at at="@60 Gas" >}} Pull 2 drones off of gas | Send 1 of these drones to take your Third base{{< / >}}

{{< at at="27 Third Hatchery" >}} {{< / >}}

{{< at at="@100 gas Metabolic boost" >}} (zergling speed){{< / >}}

{{< at at="29 Third Queen" >}} {{< / >}}

{{< at at="31 Overlord" >}} {{< / >}}

{{< at at="@100% first inject" >}} Make 2 drones from your main and rally into gas{{< / >}}

{{< at at="40 Overlord" >}} {{< / >}}

{{< at at="42 Fourth Queen " >}}(@Natural Base){{< / >}}

{{< at at="@3:30 Scout" >}} Send overlord into their main to scout{{< / >}}

{{< at at="44 Fifth Queen " >}} Fifth Queen| (Use this queen to place a tumor in your main base){{< / >}}

{{< at at="46 Overlord" >}}{{< / >}}

{{< at at="@3rd Hatchery 6th Queen" >}}{{< / >}}

#### 1-1-1 Reaction

Scouting tells: 
Marine after reaper
Hellions



{{< at at="@35 Drones " >}} Go up to 12-16 Zerglings to defend hellions {{< / >}}

{{< at at="@4:15" >}} 1 more gas, baneling nest, lair{{< / >}}

{{< at at="@4:30 " >}}1 spore in each base{{< / >}}

benchmark:
 try hitting 50 drones by 4:30

{{< at at="@5:00 " >}} 2 Evolution Chambers, 2 more Extractors{{< / >}}

{{< at at="@5:00 - 6:00 " >}}If they have made more than 8 hellions it likely means its mech, a roach warren should be dropped if you suspect mech{{< / >}}

{{< at at="@100% Lair" >}}Overseer scout to confirm bio or mech{{< / >}}


{{< at at="@100% Lair" >}}Bane speed, Hydra Den + 1 Extractor if going hydra ling bane| spire + 2 Extractors if going muta ling bane {{< / >}}

{{< at at="@5:30-6:00 " >}}Forth base + Macro hatchery (extra hatchery for larva){{< / >}}

Benchmark:
 have 66 drones around 5:30-6:00 depending how your early game went

#### 2-1-1 Reaction

Scouting tells:
Reactor right after reaper
No hellions
2nd barracks

{{< at at="@3:45 " >}}Evolution Chamber{{< / >}}

{{< at at="@100% Evolution Chamber" >}}+1 Carapace{{< / >}}

{{< at at="@4:15 " >}}1 more Extractor{{< / >}}

benchmark:
 should be able to hit 50 drones here 

{{< at at="@after droning " >}}Make 30 zerglings and 2 more queens(total 6 creep queens){{< / >}}

{{< at at="@5:00 " >}}Lair + Bane Nest{{< / >}}

Two medivac drop with 16 marines: defend with your 6 creep queens and ~30 lings

After defending add on 2 more Extractors and second Evolution Chamber for +1 attack

Careful of the followup 32 marine drop/push with +2, keep lings outside their base to scout for any move outs.

## Mid Game VS Bio

Checkpoint: 
Beat their 1-1 push or defend their double marine drop


#### Hydralisk
Generally, five gases will support a solid ling bane hydra army. You do not need additional gasses till hive when you get 7 with viper tech and 8 with ultralisk.

{{< at at="@100% Hydra Den " >}} Get movement speed, then range {{< / >}}

<!-- change -->
You want to make around 20 Hydras maximum if going the ling bane hydra ultra path to avoid body blocking the melee units.  When engaging with ling bane hydra, you want to engage, and back up with your hydras once your ling bane is killed (if it is killed).

#### Mutalisk
If you are going mutalisk, you should be going for 6 gasses as opposed to the 5 gasses hydra ling bane takes.

{{< at at="@100% 4th hatchery " >}} Go up to 8 gasses and around 80 drones{{< / >}}

{{< at at="@100% Spire" >}} +1 Air Attack{{< / >}}

{{< at at="@100% Spire " >}}Get as many mutas as you are comfortable with (minimum 12){{< / >}}


## Late Game vs Bio

Checkpoint: At this point you are either in a commanding position or have just held the 2-2 push, so from here you'll want to move into the T3 choices that zerg has to offer.

Add the ultralisk or broodlord build to the below for late game vs bio depending on which late game tech you want to play.

{{< at at="@100% 1-1 upgrades get 2-2 " >}} This should be around 7:30 if you got your 1-1 upgrades on time{{< / >}}
{{< at at="@7:30-8:00 Infestation Pit " >}} Get the appropriate amount of gasses (7 if hydra ling bane viper, 8 if with ultralisk){{< / >}}
{{< at at="@100% Hive" >}}Get viperrs if they have tanks{{< / >}}
{{< at at="@100% Hive " >}}Get T3 upgrades (+3/+3 and adrenal){{< / >}}


#### Ultralisk
When going ultralisk, you want maximum around 3-4 just for tanking, since they are very clunky and rarely get more value the more there are.

{{< at at="@100% Hive " >}}Ultralisk Cavern{{< / >}}
{{< at at="@100% Ultralisk Cavern " >}}Ultra armor then speed{{< / >}}

Ultralisk tips
<ul> -You should always have your ultralisk in front so they dont get stuck behind the rest of your army </ul>
<ul> -Using ultralisk in counterattacks againts planetary fortresses is very useful as they take almost no damage from the cannon and can soak a lot for the lings/banes </ul>
<ul> -Remember not to get too many ultralisk as they will progressively get worse the more you make. </ul>
<ul> -Once the terran gets ghosts you will need to get infestors so they dont kill your ultralisk for free. </ul>

#### Broodlord Timing
I wouldn't reccomend broodlords againts terran because they really stunt your movement potential, but there are some strong broodlord timings you can do if the terran isn't prepared if you hit it correctly, this part just shows how to efficiently get broodlords out.
{{< at at="@100% Infestation Pit " >}}Spire & Hive at the same time{{< / >}}
{{< at at="@100% Hive " >}}Greater Spire{{< / >}}
{{< at at="@50% Greater Spire " >}}Make corruptors{{< / >}}
{{< at at="@100% Greater spire " >}}Get +1 Flier attack{{< / >}}

Broodlord tips
<ul> -You always want to have a buffer with your broodlords to pretend the terran army from just running onto them. </ul>
<ul> -If the terran hasn't taken any defining engagements in the last little while you probably dont want to attack with the broodlords as a potentially game throwing fight could be taken, instead get infestors or vipers and play slower. </ul>
