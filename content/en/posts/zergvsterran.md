16 â€“ Hatchery (pull a drone from your mineral line @ ~200 minerals)
18 â€“ Gas (rally 17th drone from egg)
17 â€“ Spawning Pool (rally 18th drone from egg)
Saturate Gas through rallying the next 2 drones and 1 from minerals

What to scout after

## Mid Game VS Bio

Checkpoint: 



#### Hydralisk
Generally 5 gases supports a solid ling bane hydra army, which means you do not need to take additional gases until you want to start teching. You can take gases slightly earlier or later depending on the game, your economy and how many banelings you have needed to make throughout the game.

@100% Hydralisk Den / ~7:00 â€“ Muscular Augments (Hydralisk Speed)
@100% Muscular Augments / ~8:10 â€“ Grooved Spines (Hydralisk Range)

You want to make ~20 Hydras maximum if going the ling bane hydra ultra path. This is primarily due to ultralisks getting stuck on hydras, but also once you get past 20 hydras it is hard to get concaves large enough for them all to be attacking. When engaging with ling bane hydra you want to engage, and back up with your hydras once your ling bane is killed (if it is killed).

#### Mutalisk
Mutalisk are more gas intensive than hydralisk which means you need to take your gases faster. If you are going mutalisk, you should already have 6 gases.

@100% 4th Hatchery + ~70+ drones â€“ 2x Extractors (total 8 gases)
@100% Spire â€“ +1 Air Attacks
@100% Spire â€“ ~14 Mutalisk | enough Mutalisk for harass, map control and to shut down drops

## Late Game vs Bio

Checkpoint: You can start this late game vs bio section as soon as it is safe to drone up to 80. Generally you will have started producing your mid game tech units and are safe to drone to 80 once you have defended whatever type of pressure the Terran is choosing to apply (or right away if they are playing super defensive which is rare with bio). Generally this is whatever followup after 2-1-1 they do or defending a bio (+tank/mine) push after the opening hellion pressure if they opened with 1-1-1.

Add the ultralisk or broodlord build to the below for late game vs bio depending on which late game tech you want to play.

Drone to ~80 + take a 5th base
@+1/+2|+2/+2 â€“ +2 melee (if 2-1-1) and +1 Range if you are playing Hydralisk into Broodlord
@8:00-8:30 â€“ Infestation Pit + 1 Extractor (if hydralisk)| As you have the gas for it (depends on the game, could be later than 8:30)
@100% Infestation Pit â€“ Hive + 2 Extractors (if hydralisk 8 total now)
@100% Hive â€“ ~3-4 Vipers if they are Bio Tank
@300 Gas â€“ +3 Carapace
@200 Gas â€“ Adrenal Glands
@200 Gas â€“ +3 Melee

#### Ultralisk
Ultra advice

@100% Hive â€“ Ultralisk Cavern
@100% Ultralisk Cavern â€“ Chitinous Plating + Ultra Production Right away

Ultralisk are powerful late game units, so make sure you prioritize making 3+ Ultras once you have the tech available.

#### Broodlord Timing
Faster Broodlord builds can be very strong especially against Terrans which invest more heavily into siege tanks. Building more than 20 hydralisks can be good when going broodlords since there is nothing on the ground for your hydralisks to get stuck on (or to get stuck on your hydralisks). Additionally extra queen production is good as transfuse is a crucial ability when broodlords are a main part of your army.

@100% Infestation Pit â€“ Spire right after starting hive | If you donâ€™t already have a spire from going Mutalisk
@100% Spire 100% Hive â€“ Greater Spire
Make 6-10 Corruptors to Morph into broodlords
@100% Greater Spire â€“ +1 Flier Attack
