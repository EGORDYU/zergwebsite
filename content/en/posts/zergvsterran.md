#### If you're new to Zerg this page gives a detailed summary of each part of the game and how to react to certain things the terran does
<!--more-->

## Standard Opener

This is whats commonly known as the QLASH opening, since zergs on the team QLASH broke it into the meta, you will get your third down before the reaper arrives.

{{< at at="13 Overlord" >}} {{< / >}}

{{< at at="16 Hatchery" >}} (pull a drone from your mineral line @ ~200 minerals){{< / >}}

{{< at at="18 Gas" >}} (rally 17th drone from egg){{< / >}}

{{< at at="17  Spawning Pool " >}} (rally 18th drone from egg){{< / >}}

{{< at >}} Saturate Gas through rallying the next 2 drones and 1 from minerals{{< / >}}

{{< at at="@6:00 " >}}Forth base + macro hatch{{< / >}}

{{< at at="@6:00 " >}} Fourth Base + 2x Extractors{{< / >}}



What to scout after

## Mid Game VS Bio

Checkpoint: 
Beat their 1-1 push or defend their double marine drop


#### Hydralisk
Generally 5 gases supports a solid ling bane hydra army,you do not need additional gasses till hive.

{{< at at="@100% Hydra Den " >}} Get movement speed, then range {{< / >}}

You want to make ~20 Hydras maximum if going the ling bane hydra ultra path. This is primarily due to ultralisks getting stuck on hydras, but also once you get past 20 hydras it is hard to get concaves large enough for them all to be attacking. When engaging with ling bane hydra you want to engage, and back up with your hydras once your ling bane is killed (if it is killed).

#### Mutalisk
If you are going mutalisk, you should be going for 6 gasses as opposed to the 5 gasses hydra ling bane takes.

{{< at at="@100% 4th hatchery " >}} Go up to 8 gasses and around 80 drones{{< / >}}

{{< at at="@100% Spire" >}} +1 Air Attack{{< / >}}

{{< at at="@100% Spire " >}}Get as many mutas as you are comfortable with (minimum 12){{< / >}}


## Late Game vs Bio

Checkpoint: At this point you are either in a commanding position or have just held the 2-2 push, so from here you'll want to move into the T3 choices that zerg has to offer.

Add the ultralisk or broodlord build to the below for late game vs bio depending on which late game tech you want to play.

{{< at at="@100% 1-1 upgrades get 2-2 " >}} This should be around 7:30 if you got your 1-1 upgrades on time{{< / >}}
{{< at at="@7:30-8:00 Infestation Pit " >}} Get the appropriate amount of gasses (7 if hydra ling bane viper, 8 if with ultralisk){{< / >}}
{{< at at="@100% Hive" >}}Get viperrs if they have tanks{{< / >}}
{{< at at="@100% Hive " >}}Get T3 upgrades (+3/+3 and adrenal){{< / >}}


#### Ultralisk
When going ultralisk, you want maximum around 3-4 just for tanking, since they are very clunky and rarely get more value the more there are.

{{< at at="@100% Hive " >}}Ultralisk Cavern{{< / >}}
{{< at at="@100% Ultralisk Cavern " >}}Ultra armor then speed{{< / >}}

Ultralisk tips
<ul> -You should always have your ultralisk in front so they dont get stuck behind the rest of your army </ul>
<ul> -Using ultralisk in counterattacks againts planetary fortresses is very useful as they take almost no damage from the cannon and can soak a lot for the lings/banes </ul>
<ul> -Remember not to get too many ultralisk as they will progressively get worse the more you make. </ul>
<ul> -Once the terran gets ghosts you will need to get infestors so they dont kill your ultralisk for free. </ul>
{{< img src="/images/feature2/ultralisk.png" title="Notice" caption="Ultralisk" alt="image alt" width="300px" height="300px" position="center" >}}

#### Broodlord Timing
I wouldn't reccomend broodlords againts terran because they really stunt your movement potential, but there are some strong broodlord timings you can do if the terran isn't prepared if you hit it correctly, this part just shows how to efficiently get broodlords out.
{{< at at="@100% Infestation Pit " >}}Spire & Hive at the same time{{< / >}}
{{< at at="@100% Hive " >}}Greater Spire{{< / >}}
{{< at at="@50% Greater Spire " >}}Make corruptors{{< / >}}
{{< at at="@100% Greater spire " >}}Get +1 Flier attack{{< / >}}

Broodlord tips
<ul> -You always want to have a buffer with your broodlords to pretend the terran army from just running onto them. </ul>
<ul> -If the terran hasn't taken any defining engagements in the last little while you probably dont want to attack with the broodlords as a potentially game throwing fight could be taken, instead get infestors or vipers and play slower. </ul>
