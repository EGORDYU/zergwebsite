{{< alert theme="info" >}} 
This is a simple guide on how to play early-game vs terran and what unit compositions to make mid-late game.
{{< /alert >}}

This guide is not a complete step-by-step but just a general outline for new players.

## To Win, Have a Plan

A messy, random game makes you lose. You have to have a game plan. 

That plan is called a build order.

<strong>How to Read Build Orders</strong>
Figure 1:The first number on the left side of the line indicates what supply to make the object.
Figure 2:The text after the supply indicates what you're making at that supply.
Figure 3:If there is an "@" before the number, it indicates it is either a time or an amount you will have to build the object.
Figure 4: On the right side it tells you how to do it correctly.

## Simple Standard Build Order

This is a very common and easy-to-execute build order, but it will also set you up nicely for higher level of play when you improve.




| Milestone      | What to Make     | Extra info    |
| -------------: | :---------- | :----------- |
|  Supply 13 | Overlord   | Send this overlord to your second base to scout for Terran scouting SCV or any potential bunker rushes. |
|  Supply 16 | Hatchery   | Pull a drone from your mineral line @ ~200 minerals. A hatchery first is safe vs. virtually any build. |
|  Supply 18 | Gas   | |
|  Supply 17 | Spawning Pool   | |
|  Supply 20 | 2x Queens 4x Lings   | Make 2 queens and 2 sets of lings |
|  Gas 100 | Metabolic Boost | Pull 2 drones off gas |
|  Supply 30 | Third Hatchery | For larva and economy |
|  Supply 31 | Overlord ||
|  Supply 31 | Third Queen ||
|  @3:30 | Put 2 drones back on gas |For tech purposes|
|  @35 drones | Make 16 lings |To defend any hellion attacks|
|  Supply 40 | Overlord ||
|  Queens | Constantly make queens out of your natural and third base | For early game defense|
|  @3:30 Scout | Send overlord into their main base | Look for their building count and what tech they have|
|  @4:30 | Lair + Bane nest + 2 more gasses + one spore in each mineral line ||
|  @5:00 | 2 evolution chambers + 2 more gasses ||
|  @100% Lair | Hydra den or Roach Warren + Forth base + Baneling speed + 6th gas if mech ||

You can make small changes to it. For example, if you're having trouble against hellbat allins you can make your baneling nest at 4:00 instead of the recommended 4:30. However, this is the general outline to the build, and you can do with it what you wish.

## Scouting

Scouting terran is pretty simple, these are the ways to do it.

| Milestone      | What to scout with     | What you're scouting for     |
| -------------: | :---------- | :----------- |
|  First overlord across the map | Overlord   | If there is a command center it is not a proxy barracks so they cannot have any aggressive units any time soon. |
|  3:30 | Overlord   | Send the first overlord into their main base to see what structures they have. Look for any techlabs researching, if the starport one is researching its probably a banshee. |
|  6:30 | Overseer   | Make an overseer to scout if they are commiting to mech (lots of factories) or bio (lots of barracks) |

Ling Bane is a very drone heavy composition favoring trading and counterattacks rather than big fights.

Ravager ling bane is very good at trading by utilizing the swarmhost cooldown to fight mech, trading essentially free units.

{{< img src="/images/feature2/ravager-ling-bane-corruptor.PNG" title="" caption="Taking care of the BCs with ease" alt="image alt" width="400px" height="300px" position="center" >}}
Ravager ling bane corruptor is often used only when the terran player goes for a battlecruiser opening, since they won't have an impressive ground army.
