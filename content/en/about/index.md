## About

I am a grandmaster zerg player by the name "EGOR" creating a website for up-to-date guides and strategies for Zerg in Starcraft 2.
This website is meant to serve as a hub for producing zerg build orderrs and reactions as well as advertising my own coaching/replay analysis services.
I started playing Starcraft 2 somewhere around 2016, and after taking some breaks gettting Grandmaster in 2019. I focus on primarily standard and reactionary macro play. I believe that the best way to play Zerg is the safe and defensive approach with occasional harass and counter attacks. Most of the guides on the website are centered around that. However I will list options for every opening/build order that have offensive and defensive advantages to try and reach out to the maximum amount of players who might prefer different levels of aggression.


{{< expand "Coaching" >}}I charge $15/hr USD for coaching. I'll look over your replays and fix up your build order.{{< /expand >}}

{{< expand "Replay Analysis" >}}I look at replays for $3 per replay or $10 for 5 replays.{{< /expand >}}

{{< expand "Practice Games" >}}I'll keep this empty for now{{< /expand >}}
